# Learning Swift, By Making A Weather App ðŸŒ¤

This is a weather app project I followed a [tutorial]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2W9MPjrIbk&t=1594s)) to make, I then used what I learned to customize and add more features to the app to further my understanding. I followed this tutorial to give me an introductory understanding of swift and iOS development.

## Things Learned/Exposed to ðŸ§ 
* The Xcode IDE
* The Swift programming language
* SwiftUI
* iOS development project structure (views, managers, extensions, etc)
* Making calls to a API using an API key
* Processing data received from an API call via Java Script Object Notation (JSON)
* Decoding JSON files in Swift
* Using the CoreLocation Library (Apples/iOS Location Library)
* Extensions in Swift
* Basic UI design in Swift
* Displaying data retrieved with an API call using SwiftUI
* unix time format
* SF Symbol icons

## Features/Customizations I Made ðŸ”§
* Hiding the API key using a JSON file then decoding it when making a API call
* Application UI design changes
* Different background colors depending on the time of day
* Weather Icon displayed dependent on weather data from API
* Laying out additional weather information returned from the API call
* Function to convert unix time to 24hr format (Needed to display sunrise/sunset time infomation from the API)
